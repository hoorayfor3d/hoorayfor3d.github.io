Game developer, technical artist, and animator (well... sometimes). Currently Lead Technical Animator at Xaviant, working on The Culling. I've been working in games for just a little over 10 years now. The majority of this time has been spent as a technical artist / animator. My focus has been on developing animation rigs, rigging tools, animation tools, and animation networks.
