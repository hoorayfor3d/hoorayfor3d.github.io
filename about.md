Game developer, tools programmer, technical artist, and once-upon-a-time animator. Currently, Lead Tools Programmer at Hi-Rez Studios, working on various projects. Iâ€™ve been in games my entire career. The majority of this time has been spent as a technical artist and tools/pipeline developer. My focus has been developing animation rigs, rigging tools, animation tools, pipeline tools, and animation networks.
