Game developer, technical artist, and animator (well... sometimes). Currently Senior Technical Animator at Hi-Rez Studios, working on multiple projects. I've been working in games for just a little over 12 years now. The majority of this time has been spent as a technical artist / animator. My focus has been on developing animation rigs, rigging tools, animation tools, and animation networks.
