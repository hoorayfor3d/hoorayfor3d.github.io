Game developer, technical artist, coder, and once upon a time animator. Currently Senior Technical Animator at Hi-Rez Studios, working on various projects. I've been in games my entire career. The majority of this time has been spent as a technical artist / animator. My focus has been on developing animation rigs, rigging tools, animation tools, and animation networks.
